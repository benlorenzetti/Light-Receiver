Good notes at http://hacked10bits.blogspot.com/2011/12/sending-raw-ethernet-frames-in-6-easy.html

And also aschauf.landshut.org/fh/linux/udp_vs_raw/ch01s03.html

To build an Ethernet frame, need:
1. destination MAC address (6 bytes) - use the broadcast address FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
2. Source MAC address
3. Human readable name of the ethernet interface
4. Ethernet protocol number (or 802.3 length field)
5. Data - ethernet frame length must be 64 <= length <=1518 bytes,
not including the preamble or synch (or SFD) fields which are prepended
in hardware. Data length may be 46-1500 bytes.

To display network interfaces:
$ ifconfig | more

Looking for the human readable name of the ethernet interface.
In my case it was "eth0".

Have to specify the entire frame, except for preamble and CRC which is handled by the hardware.
Needs to be a contiguous array (use union/struct to help).
